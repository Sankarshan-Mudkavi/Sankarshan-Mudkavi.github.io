Over the past few years, I've had the occasional opportunity to edit code with
vim, however I've never truly embraced the editor and it's key bindings. Over
the next month, and throughout my co-op work term I intend to incrementally
learn vim. Hopefully, it'll lead me to being better at working in terminal, as
I foresee much of my co-op work requiring. Incidentally, I'm writing this post
in vim as a kind of primer, and hopefully will blog and edit hobby code
primarily with vim.

Perhaps I will someday become as used to vim as I am used to sublime.
