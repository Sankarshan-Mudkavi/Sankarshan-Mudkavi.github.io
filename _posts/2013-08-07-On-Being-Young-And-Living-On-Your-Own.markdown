In writing this post, I should probably specify what I mean by young, I mean very late teens or early twenties. I started my internship at Syracuse University on the 13th of May, 2013. Living on your own presented two unique challenges, cooking and shopping, and managing a budget. I decided that I would live off of the money that I earned during the internship.

Cooking
The purpose of cooking is generally to fill one's stomach, and of course to taste good. In my cooking escapades I manage dto make things that were simple, and tasted reasonably good; compared to the usual food that a student buys at a restaurant at least.

My breakfast generally consisted of eggs (very cheap and easy to cook), and a side of bread and cheese and green tea. Eggs, are incredibly easy to cook, and flavour too. 

Egg algorithm:
{% highlight python %}
def easy_breakfast(eggs, cheese, bread, tea, hungry = True):
	while hungry:
		consume = fry(eggs) + toast(bread, cheese) + steep(tea)
		if consume >= morning_requirement:
			hungry = False

easy_breakfast(2, 1, whole_wheat, green)
{% endhighlight %}

Lunch was usually bought; since I have not attained brownbag mastery yet, I think this is probably the best way of ensuring nourishment.
