<h3> I am a mathematical physics major at uWaterloo who is curious about how the universe works; I love solving important and hard problems and am constantly on the lookout for opportunities that would allow me to do so. I like to contribute to
Open Source, and hack on projects that are fun to build, and which help improve my understanding of the world around me. I also like
to play chess, solve puzzles, write poetry, and practice kendo.</h3>
