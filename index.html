<h3> I am a mathematical physics major at uWaterloo who like to write code and do physics; Currently I'm the technical cofounder at www.okeylabs.com, and spend most of time working on okey, so this webpage is pretty sparse. I've learnt a lot from the Open source community and try and contribute whenever possible, you can often find me on the repective IRC's or mailing lists. Feel free to contact me if you're interested in what okey does or if you want to chat about software, physics or math!</h3>
